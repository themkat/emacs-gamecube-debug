# emacs-gamecube-debug
Debug Nintendo GameCube applications and games using USB Gecko right from the comfort of Emacs! Powered by DevkitPro DevkitPPC gdb and dap-mode :) Probably works with Nintendo Wii as well, but I only use a GameCube so haven't tested it.


Inspired by [my GBA debugging package](https://github.com/themkat/emacs-gba-debug) that does the same for GameBoy Advance, but using an emulator instead of USB Gecko.


TODO: Instructions like in the GBA repo...
